# Sleepy SpellCaster

Sleepy SpellCaster is a turn-based fighting/2D platformer hybrid with a small backstory. Play as a wizard as you navigate through the Sleepy Forest mazes, collect spells, and fight enemies by casting spells to put them to sleep. Progress through the levels and avoid falling asleep yourself in order to save your fellow wizard friend who is sleeping in the center of the forest.
